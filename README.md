Better Science Labs Continued


I've forked an old project called Better Science labs.

 I'm adding extra labs which don't exist.

Iï»¿MPORTANT INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS for 1.7 and later

In 1.7, the Mk1-2 pod has been deprecated, moved into the zDeprecated directory, and are not directly accessible during loading.

To address this, I've provided a pair of scripts, one to be used on Windows and the other to be used on both Linux & OSX.  These only need to be run one time


Windows Instructions

Open the BetterScienceLabsContinued folder in Windows Explorer
Double-click on the file Windows_CopyTextures.bat (note that on most systems, you won't see the .bat)
Linux & OSX Desktop Instructions

Open the BetterScienceLabsContinued folder Desktop 
Double-click on the file:  BashCopyTextures.sh
Linux & OSX Terminal Instructions

Change to the GameData/BetterScienceLabsContinued directory
Type the following:
    bash BashCopyTextures.sh
    

Currently it has the following new labs:

Crew Cabin Science MPL-CC-2, same size as the hitchkiker
MK 2 Crewed Lab MPL-MK2-2, same length as the Large Crewed Lab, but in a Mk 2 shape
Mobile Processing Lab MPL-mk2-LC-2, same size as the Mk 2 Lander Can
Mobile Processing Lab MPL-Mk1-2-2, same size and shape as the Mk 1-2 command pod
S.N.A.C.K Retrieval Probe SRP-01
For the Firespitter mod:

Mobile Processing Lab MLS-FS-2, same size as the Firespitter crew fuselage
For the HGR mod:

Mobile Processing Lab MPL-ON-2, same size as the Onion Command pod
For the OPT mod:

J Mobile Lab LP3, short version, 1/2 the length of the supplied lab LP3
FYI, the OPT lab will be released later today (Friday, 6/12)
